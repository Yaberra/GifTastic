# GifTastic

* Created inital array of buttons 
* Created render button function to create buttons and display them to HTML 
* Did a GIPHY Ajax API query and pulled data file. 
* Run it through a for loop to grab the URL from the data on console
* I pulled still and animated images
* I was able to display the images on the screen. 
* Able to create a input and submit a new button 

What needs to be fixed: 

* Connecting the buttons to Ajax data pull right now they're not working. 

- I would need to define a function for the GIPHY data pull 
- create a new variable and be able to pull the data pull function in the new variable, which I was trying to do. However, I had gone far into the coding, so when I tried to make adjustments everything fell apart. 

What remains to be done:  
* If else statment to animate a still image when clicked and vice versa
